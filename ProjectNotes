***** UPDATES TO BUILD.XML *****
Update to build.xml:

Here is a small clean up item. I have separated my tests from the application code like this:

├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── java
|   |── test
│   │   ├── java

so I need to update the build.xml?

***** Possible ideas to try out & improve project *****

- Enhance the UI to show more than one symbol at a time. The use of JList or JTable might be useful.
Use an Add button to prompt the user for additional symbols

- Enhance the UI to label the information being displayed

- Automatically save stock symbols so when the app starts it automatically displays previous entries.
The JDK's preferences class might be handy here.
